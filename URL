Basic integration#

Integrating Ramp Instant in hosted mode is pretty straightforward - the only thing you need to do is to redirect your user to https://buy.ramp.network/. Note that this approach will work for both desktop and mobile integrations - no extra work needed! Just add a link to your app.

<a href="https://buy.ramp.network/" target="_blank">Go to Ramp Instant</a>

If you want to set some custom options for your integration, just add them as query parameters to the URL.

For example, let's set a userAddress param so that it'll be prefilled for the user.

<a
  href="https://buy.ramp.network/?userAddress=user blockchain address"
  target="_blank"
>
  Go to Ramp Instant
</a>

Now, when a user goes through the purchase flow, their crypto will be sent to the specified address.
