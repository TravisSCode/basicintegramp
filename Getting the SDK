Getting the SDK#
First, you'll need to add our SDK to your project.

If you use npm or yarn, run:

# npm
$ npm install @ramp-network/ramp-instant-sdk

# yarn
$ yarn add @ramp-network/ramp-instant-sdk
You can also use a CDN and a script tag. You can learn how to use this method here.

Using the SDK#
In order to start the widget, you need to provide some basic configuration to the constructor of our SDK.

A basic example looks like this:

new RampInstantSDK({
  hostAppName: 'Maker DAO',
  hostLogoUrl: 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*nqtMwugX7TtpcS-5c3lRjw.png',
}).show();
